            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>Mental health, encompassing emotional, psychological, and social well-being, significantly impacts daily life, physical health, and relationships. With the rise 
                of social media, user-generated content provides a valuable resource for detecting mental disorders like anxiety, panic, and depression. Despite growing 
                awareness, these conditions remain underdiagnosed due to stigma and complexity. This study leverages natural language processing (NLP) to analyze short 
                biomedical texts from Reddit (where individuals openly discuss their experiences), addressing the gap in simultaneous classification of anxiety, panic, 
                and depression, and exploring how psychometric features and contextual embeddings can enhance early detection/diagnosis and treatment.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Research Question Section -->
        <section id="research-question">
            <h2>Research Question</h2>
            <p>How can psychometric features (e.g., LIWC, Emotions, Emotional Intensity) and contextual embeddings be combined to effectively classify mental 
               disorders (anxiety, panic, depression) in short biomedical texts from social media?</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Hypothesis Section -->
        <section id="hypothesis">
            <h2>Hypothesis</h2>
            <p>“Psychometric features (LIWC, emotion detection, emotion intensity) and contextual embeddings (SBERT) can be effectively combined using machine learning and 
                deep learning models to achieve high accuracy in classifying anxiety, panic, and depression in short biomedical texts from social media, outperforming models 
                using individual feature sets.”
                <br>This hypothesis is based on prior research suggesting that combining semantic (contextual embeddings) and psychological and psychometric features information 
                enhances mental health classification, as these features capture both linguistic patterns and emotional nuances in text.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Dataset Section -->
        <section id="dataset">
            <h2>Dataset</h2>
            <p>The study collects data from Reddit, leveraging its specialized mental health subreddits to obtain user-generated posts related to anxiety, panic, 
                and depression (as detailed in Table 3.1 of the report). Data was scraped using <strong>Apify</strong>, a web scraping tool capable of extracting up to 1000 posts per subreddit, ensuring efficiency and 
                compliance with website policies. Only original posts were collected, excluding comments, to maintain comprehensive and self-contained descriptions of 
                mental health experiences. Broad subreddits like r/mentalhealth and r/anxietydepression were excluded to avoid ambiguity in labeling. This dataset comprises 7,866 
                unique posts, forming a rich textual corpus for feature extraction and psychometric analysis. </p>
            <p>The data cleaning process ensured high-quality input for analysis by removing duplicates, checking for missing values, and filtering texts based on length. 
                Two duplicate rows were eliminated to prevent redundancy, and no missing values were found. Texts with fewer than 10 words were removed to ensure meaningful 
                context, while texts exceeding 1024 words were excluded to maintain compatibility with transformer-based models. The dataset was labeled into three 
                categories—anxiety, panic, and depression—based on the source subreddits. To address class imbalance, undersampling was applied, reducing the majority 
                classes to match the minority class, resulting in a balanced dataset with approximately 1,812–1,815 rows per category. This resulted in a final balanced dataset 
                of 5,441 rows, ensuring better generalization and model reliability.</p>

            <h2>Methodology</h2>
            <p>This study employed a structured pipeline involving data collection and pre-processing, feature extraction, and model evaluation to classify mental disorders in short 
                biomedical texts.</p>
            <h3>Feature Extraction</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Contextual Embeddings: </strong> After experimenting with multiple BERT-based models such as <code>bert-base-nli-mean-tokens</code>from 
                    <code>HuggingFace</code>, <code>all-distilroberta-v1</code> under <code>SentenceTransformers</code> was chosen for subsequent experiemnts as it yielded the best results in terms of classification
                    performance.

                </div>
                <li>
                    <strong>Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) - 22 Features:</strong> The text analysis software LIWC quantifies linguistic and psychological features, with 
                    118 features measuring aspects like lifestyle, family, work, culture, money, and illness. Summary measures analyze analytical thinking, clout, authenticity, 
                    and emotional tone, with scores ranging from 1 to 99. The tool also provides fundamental statistics like word count and words per sentence.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Emotions Detection:</strong> Incorporated <code>EmoRoBERTa</code>, a fine-tuned model based on RoBERTa. It employs multi-label classification, assigning 
                    multiple emotion labels to a single text, reflecting the complexity of human emotions. The model outputs 28 probability scores, summing to 1, representing 
                    emotions such as amusement, caring, realization, nervousness, optimism, etc.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Emotion Intensity:</strong> Emotion intensity measures the strength of emotions expressed in text, where words like "miserable" convey stronger 
                    feelings than "sad." Using the NRC Emotion Intensity Lexicon (NRC-EIL), which contains 9,829 words with intensity scores from 0 to 1, the 
                    approach evaluates eight basic emotions—anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, and trust. Texts are converted to lowercase, and 
                    intensity is calculated as the mean score of identified words.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Results and Findings</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Logistic Regression (LR):</strong> Achieved the highest weighted F1 score of 81.9% when combining sentence embeddings with emotions, 
                    outperforming other configurations.</li>
                <li><strong>Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB):</strong> Reached an weighted F1 score of 80.3% when embeddings, normalized LIWC features, and 
                    emotions were combined, with strong performance but slightly lower than LR.</li>
                <li><strong>Deep Learning (LSTM + CNN):</strong> Obtained an F1 score of 80.7% with LSTM(32) + CNN(5,2), showing competitive results but 
                    highlighting challenges in modeling nuanced mental health texts.</li>
                <li><strong>Feature Impact:</strong> Combinations of contextual embeddings, emotions, and intensity outperformed LIWC features alone, with 
                    normalized LIWC improving performance when integrated with embeddings.</li>

            <p>These findings suggest that psychometric features and contextual embeddings are powerful for mental disorder classification, with LR being the most effective model for this dataset.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>This study demonstrates that psychometric features (LIWC, emotions, intensity) and contextual embeddings can effectively classify anxiety, panic, and depression in short biomedical texts from social media, with Logistic 
                Regression achieving the best performance (F1 score of 81.9%). The results highlight the potential of NLP for early mental health detection, reducing stigma, and improving outcomes, while suggesting future work on larger datasets, 
                along with hyperparameter tuning, and incorporating Large Language Models (LLMs) for deeper insights and causal inferencing.</p>
