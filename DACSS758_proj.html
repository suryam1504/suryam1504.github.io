        <!-- Background Section -->
        <section id="background">
            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>Online consumer reviews are a cornerstone of modern decision-making, especially on platforms like Amazon and IMDb, where millions of reviews guide choices for 
                movies and TV shows. These platforms often include helpfulness voting mechanisms, allowing users to indicate a review’s usefulness. Despite their importance, 
                the factors driving perceived helpfulness—such as review length, sentiment, and readability—remain underexplored. This study focuses on the movie and TV show 
                domain to uncover how these elements influence engagement, building on prior research suggesting that emotional intensity, review depth, and clarity play key 
                roles. <br>
                Understanding these dynamics is vital for optimizing review visibility, enhancing consumer decisions, and empowering content creators to write impactful reviews. 
                It also contributes to broader insights into digital consumer behavior and natural language processing.</p>

        <!-- Research Question Section -->
        <section id="research-question">
            <h2>Research Question</h2>
            <p>What factors influence the likelihood of receiving a higher overall voting/perceived helpfulness in movie and TV show reviews?</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Hypothesis Section -->
        <section id="hypothesis">
            <h2>Hypothesis</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>H1:</strong> The readability of a review has a curvilinear relationship with perceived helpfulness—reviews with moderate readability scores receive more votes, while very low or very high readability reduces vote counts.</li>
                <li><strong>H2:</strong> The length of a review has a curvilinear relationship with perceived helpfulness—short reviews receive fewer votes, vote counts increase with length up to a threshold, then decrease for overly long reviews.</li>
                <li><strong>H3:</strong> Reviews with strongly positive or negative sentiments receive higher vote counts compared to neutral sentiment reviews.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These hypotheses are grounded in prior studies suggesting that extreme sentiments engage readers emotionally, while balanced length and readability optimize informativeness and accessibility.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Dataset Section -->
        <section id="dataset">
            <h2>Dataset</h2>
            <p>The study uses the <a href="https://nijianmo.github.io/amazon/index.html" target="_blank">Amazon Review/Product Dataset</a> from UCSD, spanning May 1996 to October 2018, with 233.1 million reviews across categories. This project focuses on the "Movies and TV Shows" subset, pre-processed to include 10,419 reviews after filtering out rows with missing votes and extreme lengths (under 10 or over 1024 words).</p>
        </section>

        <!-- Methodology Section -->
        <section id="methodology">
            <h2>Methodology</h2>
            <p>This study employs a comprehensive pipeline: Creating corpus and summarization, Tokenization and data pre-processing, Creating DFM and Feature Co-occurrence matrix,
                Wordclouds, Readability Scoring, Review Length, Sentiment Analysis, Topic Modelling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), and Negative Binomial regression to analyze review helpfulness.</p>
            <h3>Data Pre-processing</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Loaded 50,000 reviews, filtered to 10,419 after removing missing votes and extreme lengths.</li>
                <li>Calculated review length and tokenized text using R libraries like <code>quanteda</code> and <code>tidytext</code>.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Readability, Length, and Sentiment Analysis</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Readability was assessed with Flesch-Kincaid scores using <code>textstat_readability</code>.</li>
                <li>Review lengths were grouped into bins of 50 words (e.g., 1–50, 51–100, etc.), and the total helpfulness votes for each bin were calculated and 
                    plotted to analyze the trend of votes as review length increases.</li>
                <li>Sentiment polarity was computed using dictionary-based methods and NRC Word-Emotion Association lexicon from packages <code>SentimentAnalysis</code>, 
                    and compared it with <code>liwcalike</code>.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Statistical Modeling</h3>
            <p>Due to overdispersion in vote counts (mean: 7.97, variance: 513.12), a Negative Binomial regression model was used to evaluate the effects of length, polarity, and readability on votes.</p>

                <li><strong>Readability:</strong> Coefficient 0.0062 (p < 0.001) suggests higher readability increases votes, with evidence of a curvilinear peak.</li>
                <li><strong>Review Length:</strong> Coefficient 0.0022 (p < 0.001) indicates a significant positive effect on votes, though curvilinear trends suggest an

            </ul>
